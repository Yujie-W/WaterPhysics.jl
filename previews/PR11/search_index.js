Surface tension changes impacts the plant water     transport via two aspects. First, if surface tension is lower, for a     constant soil water content, the soil matrix potential gets less negative     because the capillary pressure at the air-water interface decreases. And     this is beneficial to plants. Second, the air-water interface at the pit     membrane also has lower capillary pressure when temperature increases,     meaning that the xylem conduits are less resistant to drought-induced     air-seeded cavitation. And this is harmful for plants. Though the surface     tension does not differ much with temperature change within the plant     physiological active range, we account for this effect in our Land model.","category":"page"},{"location":"API/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"surface_tension\nrelative_surface_tension","category":"page"},{"location":"API/#WaterPhysics.surface_tension","page":"API","title":"WaterPhysics.surface_tension","text":"surface_tension(T::FT) where {FT<:AbstractFloat}\nsurface_tension(T::Array{FT}) where {FT<:AbstractFloat}\n\nSurface tension [N m⁻¹] of water against air, given\n\nT (Array of) temperature\n\nThe equation used is\n\nγ = 02358 \n    left( 1 - dfracTT_c right)^1256 \n    left 1 - 0625  left( 1 - dfracTT_c right) right\n\nSee http://www.iapws.org/relguide/Surf-H2O.html\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"API/#WaterPhysics.relative_surface_tension","page":"API","title":"WaterPhysics.relative_surface_tension","text":"relative_surface_tension(T::FT) where {FT<:AbstractFloat}\nrelative_surface_tension(T::Array{FT}) where {FT<:AbstractFloat}\n\nRelative surface tension of water against air relative to 298.15 K, given\n\nT (Array of) temperature\n\nThe equation used is\n\nγ = 02358 \n    left( 1 - dfracTT_c right)^1256 \n    left 1 - 0625  left( 1 - dfracTT_c right) right\n\nSee http://www.iapws.org/relguide/Surf-H2O.html\n\nA reference temperature at 298.15 K is used because the hydraulic conductances and vulnerability curves of plants are described at 298.15 K.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"API/#Vapor-pressure","page":"API","title":"Vapor pressure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"API/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"When temperature increases, liquid water vapor pressure increases     exponentially.

This effect is pretty significant as 1 degree increase of     temperature results in about 2.4% drop in viscosity, and this is very     beneficial to plant water transport. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, very     few models account for this effect when modeling plant hydraulics because     of the difficulty in modeling the energy budget along the flow path. We     plan to have this effect accounted for in our CliMA Land model, by     computing the water tempreature along the flow path and thus the viscosity     change.
