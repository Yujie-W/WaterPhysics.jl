Surface tension changes impacts the plant water transport via two aspects. First, if surface tension is     lower, for a constant soil water content, the soil matrix potential gets less negative because the capillary pressure at the air-water interface decreases. And this is beneficial to plants.     Second, the air-water interface at the pit membrane also has lower capillary pressure when temperature increases, meaning that the xylem conduits are less resistant to drought-induced air-seeded     cavitation. And this is harmful for plants. Though the surface tension does not differ much with temperature change within the plant physiological active range, we account for this effect in our     Land model.
